# Project 2

## Background
For project 2, I will be setting up a Stock Trading Website with multiple aspects of functionality. Users will be able to create, edit and delete their personal accounts. Users will also be able to deposit and withdraw funds. 

Users will then be able to interact with other users to collaborate, discuss, combine funds, etc. Finally, users or groups of users will also be able to purchase/sell stocks or investments through the website.  

I took the approach of creating an ERD diagram and beginning with the creation of my models/tables. From there I tweaked them to have the proper associations and then began to setup my routes. Once the routes were partially in place I created the basic .ejs files that would be rendered. Each of these steps included vast amounts of trial and error and troubleshooting. 

Once this basic skeleton was created I could add complexity and bring in css styling. Finally, many cycles were ran through the app to roll out any bugs that arose. 

## Future Additions

This submitted app is about 10% of the original functionality I planned and nowhere near what I pictured. Many little hurdles with my first associations and heroku deployment consumed a lot of my time. 

I would continue to add routes and ways users/groups can add funds, make trades or investments and interact on the feed/chat pages. Additionally, I would like to pull a stock ticker API into the investments section to keep everything more up to date and real-world.

Lastly, once we delve into the python section, it would be cool to add data analysis tools.
